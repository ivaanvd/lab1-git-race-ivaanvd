# Lab 1 Git Race -- Project Report

## Description of Changes
### Controller Changes

- The `HelloController` was updated so that the greeting message now includes a time-based greeting ("Good morning", "Good afternoon", or "Good night") depending on the current hour.
- If the user provides a name, the greeting is personalized For example, if it's 7 o'clock and the user provides a name,  the greeting will be "Good morning, Developer!".
- If no name is provided, the greeting combines the time-based greeting with the default message  "Good morning, Test Message".
- The same logic was applied to the API controller for JSON responses.

### Test Changes

- Unit and MVC tests were updated to reflect the new greeting logic.
- Tests now check that the message starts with "Good" and contains either the default message or the provided name, depending on the scenario.
- This ensures that both the time-based and personalized aspects of the greeting are correctly validated.

### Summary

These changes improve the user experience by providing dynamic, time-based greetings on both the web page and API responses. The tests were adapted to verify the new behavior, ensuring reliability and correctness.

## Technical Decisions
- Used the current system time to determine the appropriate greeting (morning, afternoon, or night)
- Kept the default message as a fallback when no name is provided, ensuring clarity and consistency.
- Use of string pattern checks in tests to test all the posible greetings.
- Updated both the controller and API logic to maintain uniform behavior across web and API responses.

## Learning Outcomes
- Improved skills in working with controllers, API endpoints, and test frameworks in Kotlin and Spring Boot.
- Learned how to use the current time in a web application.
- Updating backend logic and automated tests to support new features.
- Saw how small changes in code can affect both the user experience and the way tests are written.

## AI Disclosure
### AI Tools Used
- Chat GPT
- Copilot in Visual Studio Code

### AI-Assisted Work
Most of the work was done with AI assistance. I used ChatGPT and Copilot to generate initial versions of the code, especially because I was not familiar with Kotlin. I asked for suggestions, tried to understand them, and then made my own corrections until everything worked as expected.

I estimate that about 60% of the work was AI-assisted and 40% was my own effort. I often modified the AI-generated code to fix errors or adapt it to the requirements.

### Original Work
I worked on understanding the code generated by AI and made changes myself when needed. This helped me learn more about Kotlin, Spring Boot, and how to write and test controllers. The process involved reading, testing, and correcting code until I was confident in the solution.
